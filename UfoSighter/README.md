# Ufo Sighting Predictor
This project involves cleaning a dataset based on UFO sightings recorded in 5 countries across the globe, analysing it and then using it
to train a linear regression model to predict the country in which ufo sighting is likely based upon the inputs by the user.
python libraries used for data analysing are matplotlib and tensorflow for making the model. the user interface is built upon
python flask web framework. screen snippets of the frontend have been stored in the respective folder. Do reach out in case of any doubts.
